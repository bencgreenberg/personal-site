# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and utilizing the [Tailwind Astro Starter Blog template](https://github.com/wanoo21/tailwind-astro-starting-blog).

## Usage

### Extend / Customize

`src/consts.ts` contains a list of constants that you can customize to your liking, including the blog title, description, author, social media links, etc.

`src/functions.ts` contains a list of functions that changes the default behavior of the template, including default post sorting and exclude draft posts.

`src/content/authors/default.mdx` contains the default author information. You can add more authors by adding more `.mdx` files in the `src/content/authors` folder.

`src/content/tags/default.mdx` contains the default tag information. You can add more tags by adding more `.mdx` files in the `src/content/tags` folder.

`src/content/config.ts` contains all fields for author, blog and tags pages. Check what's required and what's not. You can also add more fields if you want to.
